pcb-gcode is a plugin for the [Eagle schematic and board layout program](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview).
It allows you to create g-code from your board layouts so that you can use a router or milling machine to route around the traces, thus creating a printed circuit board without the need to use etching solutions, photo masks, etc.
It also creates drill files so you don't have to manually drill boards.
You can also create wires on a milling layer to be routed, and text as well.
It supports two-layer boards.

It's been a while since any updates have been made (I'm in grad school), but it still functions well, and is in use by hundreds of people around the world.
